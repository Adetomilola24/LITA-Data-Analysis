# LITA-data-analysis
This repository contains data analysis projects and exercises from the LITA data analysis course, including data exploration, visualization, and basic analytics techniques.

I'm currently working on a data analysis capstone project with LITA, building an interactive dashboard to uncover actionable insights and inform strategic decisions. You can follow my project journey here, where Iâ€™m documenting every stage from data exploration to dashboard development.
